### What is Cloud Computing?
- It is the **on-demand** delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other resources
- These are through the **internet**
- They are **pay-as-you-go** pricing
- Enable us to think of infrastructure as software

### Traditional computing model
- Infrastructure as hardware
- Require space, staff, physical security, planning, capital expenditure
- Have long hardware procurement cycle
- Require you to provision capacity by guessing theoretical maximum peaks (If predicted wrongly, resources will be under or over used)

### Cloud computing model
- Infrastructure as software
- Flexible 
- Can change more quickly, easily, and cost-effectively than hardware solutions
- Eliminate the undifferentiated heavy-lifting tasks

### Cloud Service Models
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a service): **Highest control** of resources (very similar to owning a actual server)
- PaaS (Platform as a service): Don't need to manage OS and backbone, **allows deployment** of applications only
- SaaS (Software as a service): Complete product given (Netflix, gmail, etc.)

### Cloud Computing Deployment Models
- Cloud: Applications that are fully deployed on the cloud
- Hybrid: A way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources
- On-premises (private cloud): Using virtualization and resource management tools. Does not have many of the benefits of cloud computing
